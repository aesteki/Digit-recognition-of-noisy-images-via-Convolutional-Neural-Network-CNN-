# Digit-recognition-of-noisy-images-via-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-
Designed a feed-forward CNN classifier using Keras for digit recognition through the dataset SVHN rather than MNIST; SVHN is more difficult than MNIST due to large variations of color and brightness. By normalization and binarization of images in the pre-processing step, higher accuracy on the validation data was achieved.
The project was focused on designing a feed-forward Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier for digit recognition. The classifier was implemented using the Keras library, a high-level neural network API that allows for easy and fast prototyping of deep learning models. The dataset used for the experiment was the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, which is considered more difficult than the commonly used MNIST dataset due to the large variations in color and brightness of the images.

In order to achieve higher accuracy on the validation data, the pre-processing step involved normalization and binarization of the images. Normalization helps to adjust the intensity values of the images to a common scale, thus reducing the variability in the data. Binarization involves converting the images into binary form, which helps to simplify the data and reduce noise.

The results of the experiment showed that the feed-forward CNN classifier was able to achieve higher accuracy on the validation data as compared to other models, thanks to the normalization and binarization of the images in the pre-processing step. The improved accuracy of the model can have various applications in fields such as computer vision and image processing, where digit recognition is an important task.

In conclusion, the project demonstrates the importance of pre-processing in achieving higher accuracy in deep learning models. The results of this project can be used to develop more advanced models for digit recognition in real-world scenarios, where large variations in color and brightness are commonly observed.
